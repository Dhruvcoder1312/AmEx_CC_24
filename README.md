# AmEx_CC_24
Amex Dataset Analysis

Overview

This project delves into analyzing the Amex dataset to predict customer defaults based on various financial and risk-related factors. The dataset encompasses key metrics such as credit scores, income levels, credit limits, and customer acquisition details, along with an indicator of whether a customer defaulted or not. The goal is to extract actionable insights and identify patterns that can improve default prediction models, aiding in better financial risk management.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 61 columns and 62,484 rows, offering a comprehensive look at customer profiles and their financial behaviors.

Below are the key fields included in the dataset:

unique_identifier: A unique ID assigned to each customer record.
appl_month: The month when the application was submitted.
prod_name: The product name associated with the customer.
acq_channel: The acquisition channel through which the customer was onboarded.
state_code: The state in which the customer resides.
bureau_score: Credit score provided by a bureau to evaluate the customerâ€™s creditworthiness.
risk_scores: A set of 11 risk scores estimating the probability of customer default.
limit: Credit limit assigned to the customer.
income: The customer's reported income.
default_ind: A binary indicator (1 or 0) representing whether the customer defaulted.
Handling Missing Data
The dataset includes missing values in columns such as trust_identity and addr_mismatch, which were handled to preserve the dataset's integrity:

For categorical columns like trust_identity and addr_mismatch, missing values were filled with 'Unknown'.
For numerical columns, missing values were replaced with the median of the respective column to maintain central tendency and avoid outliers.
Steps in Analysis
1. Data Cleaning
Handled missing data as described above to ensure no critical information was lost.
Standardized column names and ensured consistent data types for numerical and categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted a thorough exploration of the dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies. Key visualizations included:

Distribution Plots to examine the spread of numeric variables.
Bar and Box Plots to identify trends and outliers in categorical and numerical data.
Correlation Heatmaps to evaluate relationships between variables.
Visualizations and Key Insights
Default Indicator Distribution

The majority of customers in the dataset did not default, as shown by a count plot. This class imbalance should be considered when building predictive models.
Risk Score 1 Distribution for Default and Non-Default Cases

Customers with higher risk scores are more likely to default, making this score a strong predictive factor.
Income Distribution for Default and Non-Default Cases

Income levels do not exhibit a significant difference between customers who defaulted and those who did not, indicating that income alone may not be a reliable predictor.
Acquisition Channel vs Default Rate

Certain acquisition channels, such as specific partnerships or referral programs, are associated with higher default rates, highlighting the need for stricter evaluation of customers acquired through these sources.
Product Name vs Default Rate

Specific products, such as high-risk credit products, exhibit higher default rates. This suggests that product segmentation can play a key role in risk assessment.
Default Rates by State

Default rates vary significantly across states, potentially due to regional economic disparities. These trends can inform targeted risk mitigation strategies.
Limit Distribution for Default and Non-Default Cases

Customers with lower credit limits are more likely to default, indicating that lower limits may reflect higher credit risk.
Bureau Score vs Default Indicator

Customers with lower bureau scores are more prone to default, confirming the importance of credit scores in predicting financial risk.
Risk Score 2 vs Default Indicator

Higher values of risk_score_2 are strongly correlated with default cases, reinforcing the role of aggregated risk scores in default prediction.
Address Mismatch Distribution for Default and Non-Default Cases

Customers with address mismatches show a slightly higher likelihood of default, potentially signaling instability or fraudulent behavior.
Conclusion
This analysis highlights critical factors influencing customer defaults in the Amex dataset. Key predictors include:

Acquisition channels associated with higher risks.
Product types with increased default rates.
Credit and risk scores demonstrating strong correlations with default behaviors.
By leveraging these insights, financial institutions can improve their risk assessment frameworks and develop more targeted strategies for mitigating defaults.
